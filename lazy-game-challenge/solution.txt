First, we play clean. Wanna get to know your enemy, y'know.

It turns out I'm pretty good at guessing.

Not good enough to earn a milion this way though.

We see the game goes as follows:
    1) We place the bet.
    2) We guess numbers up to ten times.
    3) As soon as we guess correctly, we get the money.
    4) If we fail we lose the bet.

Now what does it mean we lose the bet? It means, that our balance gets updated as follows:

    balance := balance - bet

But as we all know subtraction is addition of the additive inverse. This brings that cool property, that subtracting a negative number means adding its abs.

While we were talking i tried to break the program by inputting letters where numbers should be and giving numbers where letters are expected.

When I've put a string into "Place a bet: " i got an error saying that it's an invalid literal for "int()". Error was in file "server.py"

This is good. It means that the app is written in python and it uses signed integers. Which means i can place a negative bet. For example negative milion.

Then all we need to do is to make sure we lose. Luckily numbers are always between 1 and 10, so if we just keep typing 11 we're guaranteed to lose.

And once we lose, we get 500-(-1000000) dollars.
And a flag. We get the flag too.

Neat c:
