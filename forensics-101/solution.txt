In this one first idea that comes to mind is that flag is hidden somwhere inside the file as a string. 

Was it not a basic level challenge I'd think of stenography, but it's worth trying strings first.

And thus we write in command line:

$ strings 95f6edfb66ef42d774a5a34581f19052.jpg | grep -i -E 'ctf|flag'

It just so happens it gives us our flag.

Neat c:
