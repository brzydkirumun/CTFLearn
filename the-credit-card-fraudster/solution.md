This challenge was probably one of the most enjoyable out of all that I've done yet. It mainly focuses on Luhn algorithm and a a bit on some basic number theory.
Our goal is to find credit card number knowing that it satisfies the Luhn algorithm, is divisible by 123457, starts with 543210 and ends with 1234.
For this challenge I picked haskell as it seemed perfect for such problem due to its ellegance. I don't regret it.
