This challenge was probably one of the most enjoyable out of all that I've done yet. It mainly focuses on Luhn algorithm and a a bit on some basic number theory.
Our goal is to find credit card number knowing that it satisfies the _Luhn algorithm_, is divisible by _123457_, starts with _543210_ and ends with _1234_.

For this challenge I picked haskell as it seemed perfect for such problem due to its ellegance. I don't regret it.
