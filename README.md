# CTFLearn

This repo consists of solutions to some of the CTFlearn problems that I've done. It's purpose is mainly for me to have it easy to go back to these problems, but I thought I'd share it so that if somebody's looking for a tip on how to proceed, they could find it here.

Nevertheless plz guys, do stuff by yourself. It has "learn" in its name for a reason, copying and pasting teaches you nothing.

## Pull requests
I may accept some pull requests, but not with solutions to problems I haven't done myself yet, only those that either fix some mistakes of mine (and there will probably be plenty) or provide new approach to challenge I've already solved. Otherwise it would ruin my fun, so no spoilers please c:

## What is used in solutions

- Linux terminal
- Haskell
- C
- Math
- Occasionally some additional stuff that I mention in "solution.txt" file
