As the very name suggests, flag is encrypted using Vigenere cipher.

It's a pretty basic cipher but still is enjoyable. 
I decided to go with C as in it chars are simply numbers so it is easier to perform arithmetic on them. 
For more complex cipher I'd definetly go with haskell, but here even if errors occured, they'd be easily debuggable.

First I took a peek at the codetext to see how was the cipher implemented. It consisted only of letters, both lower and uppercase and of curly braces. What's more: opening curly braces were fifth character (after 4 others, presumably: "flag") and the string ended with closed curly braces which led me to think that they were probably not encrypted at all.

So our cipher ignores all non-alphabetical characters and handles both lower and uppercase letters.
The way uppercase letters were sprinkled in the text led me to believe that it is a classic Vigenere cipher, with little tweek, that it encrypts lowercase into lowercase and uppercase into uppercase.
